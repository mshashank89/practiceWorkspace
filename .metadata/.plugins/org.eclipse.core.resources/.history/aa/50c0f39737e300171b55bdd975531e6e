- Scenario:
--------------
- 200 threads created using a CachedThreadPool.
- All threads are requesting for a connection from the Connection class.

*****************************************************************************************************************
* Not using semaphores will result in all 200 connections being formed at a time.
  
  This is not good in a real time scenario, where it will cause an overhead, resulting in performance issues.
  So, it is better to limit the number of threads that can create connections. 
  
* Max number of connections at a time is limited to 10 by the use of semaphores.
