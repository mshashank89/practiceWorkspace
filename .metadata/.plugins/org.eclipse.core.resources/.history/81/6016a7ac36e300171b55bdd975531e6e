- Connection is a singleton.
- Maximum connections that is possible at any given time is defined as 10.

********************************************************************************************************************
*  Semaphore is used to limit the number of connections at a given time.
*  semaphore.acquire() is analogous to lock.lock()
*  semaphore.release() is analogous to lock.unlock()
*  
*  semaphore is a lock that can be locked more than once.
*  
*  Constructor:  Semaphore(int permit, boolean fair)
*  @int permit: defines the number of times the semaphore can be locked. 
  				In the below example, 10 threads can acquire the semaphore. After the 10th thread has acquired the
  				semaphore, the 11th thread has to wait for one of the 10 threads to release() the semaphore in order
  				to be given the permit.
*  
*  @ boolean fair: When fairness parameter is set to true, it means that, the thread that calls the acquire() first,
*  				   will be the first to be given the permit.
