- Scenario:
--------------
- 200 threads created using a CachedThreadPool.
- All threads are requesting for a connection from the Connection class.

*****************************************************************************************************************
* Use of sunchronized block will synchronize the create connection code. But it will not restrict 
  the number of connections that can be formed. All 200 conections will be formed at a time.
  
  This is not good in a real time scenario, where it will cause an overhead, resulting in performance issues.
  So, it is better to limit the number of threads that can create connections. 
  
  This is achieved by the use of semaphores.
   
* Max number of connections at a time is limited to 10 by the use of semaphores.
